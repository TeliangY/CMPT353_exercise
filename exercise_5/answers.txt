1.
The 'np.sqrt' transformation is the closest satisfying the assumptions of a T-test. 
	exp()
	# # Transformed data normality p-values: nan nan
    	# # Transformed data equal-variance p-value: nan
	the p-values are NAN so we can not use this one
	count**2
	# # Transformed data normality p-values: 2.78e-29 2.99e-11
	# # Transformed data equal-variance p-value: 7.39e-08
	the p-values of normaltest and p-value of levene are all smaller than 0.05 which means it fails the assumptions of T-test. 
	log()
	# # Transformed data normality p-values: 0.000402 0.315
	# # Transformed data equal-variance p-value: 0.000419 
	the p-value of levene of taking 'np.log' is smaller than 0.05 which means it fails the equality of variances. 
	sqrt()
	# Transformed data normality p-values: 0.0369 0.108
	# Transformed data equal-variance p-value: 0.556
	the p-value of levene is larger than 0.05, so it doesn't fail the equality of variances. 
Thus, 'np.sqrt' is better for T-test.

Original T-test:
If the null hypothesis is rejected then we can conclude that the means of the number of comments on weekends and weekdays are different.
Transformed data T-test:
If the null hypothesis is rejected then the conlusion is that the mean of the square root of number of comments on weekends and weekdays are different.
3.
Central Limit Theorem does a better job of getting an answer for the original question. 
Since after applying the Central Limit Theorem:
Weekly data normality p-values: 0.308 0.153
Weekly data equal-variance p-value: 0.204a
the normal test and equality of variances test satisfy the requiements of T-test which means it can make the p-value of the result more convincing.
4.
The mean amount of tweets for weekdays is more than on weekends.
So that there is more data for the weekdays. 
With all the testing there's is no way to prove that one or the other has more comments.
