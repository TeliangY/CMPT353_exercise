The regression p-value is 1.5139606492960756e-106 so that y does not linearly depend on x, and the histogram shows
a left-skewed distribution, which should be enough to consider the OLS p-value. Then we can conclude that
the ratings are increasing, and residuals look close enough to be normal.
2.
Yes, it captures more of the actual CPU temperature than the original. Extreme outliers are still ignored,
taking into account the high short-term load on the CPU that can cause wild temperature fluctuations.
It looks better having the prediction for the next value in the filter.
