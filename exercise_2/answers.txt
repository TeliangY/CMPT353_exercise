1. 
y = kx + b, x is data['timestamp'], k is fit.slope and b is fit.intercept.
The type of the values(y) are float numbers representing
the potential score on each timestamp which is a prediction based on the linear regression model of data.
2. 
Because created_at and timestamp are different values of the same thing, the amount of the is equal. 
The ratings (y-axis) are not changing on the graph, and only the x-axis is. 
Therefore, when we plot the line, the x values are paired
because there are an equal amount and the y values are properly fit for the line.
