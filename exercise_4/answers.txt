The data does not show a linear relation. 
Therefore it is not a good way to predict population density. 
There does not seem to be an apparent relation between temperature and population density.

There is a big difference in size between compressed and uncompressed files, 
and because Gzip can be compressed and uncompressed quickly, it is more efficient when exchanging data.
