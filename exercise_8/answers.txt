Bayesian classifier:    0.562 0.645
kNN classifier:         0.753 0.755
Rand forest classifier: 0.751 0.735
Knn model  shows highest score, and the reason is color changes not drastically.
Knn model which takes nearest neighbours can make more reasonable prediction.
We can specific the number of training point the model must compare making a decision. 
2.
Yes, the model seems to make reasonable mistakes since some cities might have similar conditions, confusing the model. 
Adding some other data like latitude, longitude, snowy days will make the prediction more accurate.
