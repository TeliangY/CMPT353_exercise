1.
Using the tests chi2 squares and mannwhite u we get o-values to be greater that 0.05，
so we can reject the hypothesis， which means that the new interface is used more frequently. We are not p-hacking.
2.
So the total possible tests of choice 2 from 7 sorting implementation results is 7!/2!(7-2)! = 21,
and the possible of making a false conclusion is (1-(1-0.05)^21) = 65.9%, 
but we want the p-value less than 0.05/21 = 0.0024.
3.
The mean speed of 7 sorting implementation:
qs1               0.010370
partition_sort    0.010780
qs3               0.014230
qs2               0.014357
qs5               0.015350
qs4               0.016543
merge1            0.018155
Sorting sorting implementations by speed we can rank from fastest to slowest as qs1, partition_sort, qs2/qs3, qs5, qs4, merge1.  
The one which is not distinguishable is q2 and q3. 
In the graph from doing postdoc analysis there is the one with overlap.
