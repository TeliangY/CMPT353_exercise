1.  I think I get a better result by using the Kalman smoothing from the cpu.svg I found that the Kalman smoothing has kept more effective points as required.
(1) when the temperature spikes (because of momentary CPU usage), the high-temperature values are reality and we don't want to smooth that information out of existence, but 
(2) when the temperature is relatively flat (where the computer is not in use), the temperature is probably relatively steady, not jumping randomly between 30°C and 33°C as the data implies.
It's more sensitive when dealing with outliers.
2.   Speed and heading in degrees might be helpful to predict the next latitude and longitude so that we can create a more helpful transition matrix to forecast the next position.
